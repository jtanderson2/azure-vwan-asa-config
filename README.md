# Cisco ASA Configuration - Connecting Resilient VPN to Azure VWAN Hub

This is largely based on [this](https://github.com/jwrightazure/lab/tree/master/asa-vpn-to-active-active-azurevpngw-ikev2-bgp_)excellent article byt Jeremey Wright

I collaborated on a deep-dive session with Adam Stuart on this subject, where we delved into options (and caveats!) around using Cisco ASAs to connect to Azure VWAN. The output of that can be found here - https://github.com/adstuart/azure-vwan-asa

This repo provides a sanitised version of the working ASA configuration, with a few extra notes

Tested Cisco ASA configuration for this lab topology:
